# **PyBer Analysis**

## **Overview**
The purpose of this project is to analyze ride share data to gain an understanding of the differences between various city types (urban, rural, suburban). Using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, ride-sharing data was analyzed to see how the number of rides, number of drivers and fares differed between the three city types.

## **Results**
#### **Ride Sharing Data Summary:**

  * If we compare the total rides, total drivers and total fares between city types, we will notice that there is a prevalent application for ride sharing services in urban cities. 
    *  Total rides in urban cities is roughly 2.6 times more than suburban cities and 13 times more than rural cities
    *  Total drivers in urban cities is roughly 4.9 times more than suburban cities and 30.8 times more than rural cities
    *  Total fares in urban cities is roughly 2.1 times more than suburban cities and 9.2 times more than rural cities
  
  * In contrast, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher in rural areas when compared to urban areas. 
    * The average fare per ride in rural areas is roughly 0.4 times higher than the average fare per ride in urban areas
    * The average fare per driver in rural areas is roughly 3.3 times higher than the average fare per driver in urban areas

#### **Total Fare by City Type:**

The line graph above displays the total fares for each week by city type.
 
## **Summary**
While urban areas accumulate the highest total fares, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is highest in rural areas. This suggests that the urban cities total fares may be attributed to the sheer volume of rides. This gap may represent an opportunity to expand in more rural areas where ride sharing services may not be as prevalent. 

In the Ride Sharing Data Summary, we can see that in urban cities there are actually more drivers than total rides. This suggests that these markets may be oversaturated with supply. One thing to consider is capping the number of drivers in these areas which would also then increase the average fare per driver, making it more enticing for drivers in these areas. 

Lastly, in looking at the Total Fare by City Type chart, there is a dip in total fares in the beginning of March in all three city types. This may be an opportune time to campaign and have promotions to increase ridership across all city types.
